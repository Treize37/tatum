  # unit tests for ada_broadcast
  # Broadcast signed Ada transaction

This method is used internally from Tatum KMS, Tatum Middleware or Tatum Client Libraries. It is possible to create a custom signing mechanism and only use this method for broadcasting data to the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for ada_generate_wallet
  # Generate Ada wallet
  # &lt;h4&gt;1 credit per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. Because they can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase, they are very convenient and secure. A mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in a defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.&lt;br/&gt;Each address is identified by 3 main values:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Key - public address to be published&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Derivation index - index of generated address&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for ADA wallet with derivation path m/1852&#x27;/1815&#x27;/0&#x27;. More about BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - &lt;a target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot; href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki\&quot;&gt;https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki&lt;/a&gt;.

  # unit tests for ada_transfer_blockchain
  # Send Ada to blockchain addresses
  # &lt;h4&gt;2 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Send Ada to blockchain addresses. It is possible to build a blockchain transaction in 2 ways: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;fromAddress&lt;/b&gt; - assets will be sent from the list of addresses. For each of the addresses, the last 100 transactions will be scanned for any unspent UTXO to be included in the transaction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;fromUTXO&lt;/b&gt; - assets will be sent from the list of unspent UTXOs. Each of the UTXOs will be included in the transaction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; In bitcoin-like blockchains, a transaction is created from the list of previously unspent UTXOs. Every UTXO contains the amount of funds that can be spent. When the UTXO is entered into the transaction, the whole amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives 2 transactions, T1 with 1 ADA and T2 with 2 ADA. The transaction, which will consume the UTXOs for T1 and T2, will have an available amount to spend of 3 ADA &#x3D; 1 ADA (T1) + 2 ADA(T2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There can be multiple recipients of the transactions. In the &lt;b&gt;to&lt;/b&gt; section, every recipient address has its own corresponding amount. When the amount of funds that the recipient should receive is lower than the amount of funds from the UTXOs, the difference is used as a transaction fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This operation requires the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send their private keys to the Internet because there is a strong possibility that they will be stolen and the funds will be lost. In this method, it is possible to enter a privateKey or signatureId. The privateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchains when there is no risk of losing funds. In production, &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Tatum KMS&lt;/a&gt; should be used to ensure the highest level of security, and the signatureId should be present in the request. Alternatively, it is also possible to use the Tatum Client Library for supported languages. &lt;/p&gt;
