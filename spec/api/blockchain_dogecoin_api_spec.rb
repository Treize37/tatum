  # unit tests for doge_generate_wallet
  # Generate Dogecoin wallet
  # &lt;h4&gt;1 credit per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase. Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.&lt;br/&gt;Each address is identified by 3 main values:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Key - public address to be published&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Derivation index - index of generated address&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for Dogecoin wallet with derivation path m&#x27;/44&#x27;/3&#x27;/0&#x27;/0. More about BIP44 HD wallets can be found here - &lt;a target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot; href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/litecoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki\&quot;&gt;https://github.com/litecoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki&lt;/a&gt;.

UTXO means Unspent Transaction Output, which is in blockchain terminology assets, that user received on the specific address and does not spend it yet.&lt;br/&gt; In bitcoin-like blockchains (BTC, LTC, DOGE, BCH), every transaction is built from the list of previously  not spent transactions connected to the address. If user owns address A, receives in transaciont T1 10 DOGE, he can spend in the next transaction UTXO T1 of total value 10 DOGE. User can spend multiple UTXOs from different addresses in 1 transaction.&lt;br/&gt; If UTXO is not spent, data are returned, otherwise 404 error code.&lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for doge_transfer_blockchain
  # Send Dogecoin to blockchain addresses
  # &lt;h4&gt;2 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Send Dogecoin to blockchain addresses. It is possible to build a blockchain transaction in 1 way: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;fromUTXO&lt;/b&gt; - assets will be sent from the list of unspent UTXOs. Each of the UTXO will be included in the transaction.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; In bitcoin-like blockchains, the transaction is created from the list of previously not spent UTXO. Every UTXO contains the number of funds, which can be spent. When the UTXO enters into the transaction, the whole amount is included and must be spent. For example, address A receives 2 transactions, T1 with 1 DOGE and T2 with 2 DOGE. The transaction, which will consume UTXOs for T1 and T2, will have available amount to spent 3 DOGE &#x3D; 1 DOGE (T1) + 2 DOGE(T2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; There can be multiple recipients of the transactions, not only one. In the &lt;b&gt;to&lt;/b&gt; section, every recipient address has it&#x27;s corresponding amount. When the amount of funds, that should receive the recipient is lower than the number of funds from the UTXOs, the difference is used as a transaction fee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production, &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Tatum KMS&lt;/a&gt; should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request. Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages. &lt;/p&gt;
