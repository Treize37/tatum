  # unit tests for flow_add_pub_key_to_address
  # Add public key to Flow address
  # &lt;h4&gt;100 credits per API call. Tatum covers the fee connected to the transaction costs in subscription credits. This operation can be done on mainnet only for paid plans.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add public key to existing Flow blockchain addresses. Private key for that public key can be used for signing transaction. There are two possibilites how the transaction on the blockchain can be created: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Using mnemonic and index - private key is generated based on the index in the mnemonic.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Using secret - private keys is entered manually.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production, &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Tatum KMS&lt;/a&gt; should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request. Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages. &lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for flow_generate_wallet
  # Generate Flow wallet
  # &lt;h4&gt;1 credit per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase. Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.&lt;br/&gt;Each address is identified by 3 main values:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Key - public address to be published&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Derivation index - index of generated address&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for Dogecoin wallet with derivation path m&#x27;/44&#x27;/3&#x27;/0&#x27;/0.
