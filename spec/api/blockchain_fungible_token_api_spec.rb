  # unit tests for erc20_approve
  # Approve spending of ERC20
  # &lt;h4&gt;2 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Approve ERC20 Fungible Tokens to be spendable by someone else. This method allows new address to transfer/burn ERC20 tokens on behalf of the owner. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production, &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Tatum KMS&lt;/a&gt; should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request. Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages. &lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for erc20_deploy
  # Deploy ERC20 Smart Contract.
  # &lt;p&gt;Deploy ERC20 Smart Contract. This method creates new ERC20 (Fungible Tokens) Smart Contract on the blockchain. Smart contract is standardized and audited. It is possible to mint and burn tokens. It is possible to see the code of the deployed contract &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-middleware/blob/master/src/contracts/token.sol\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds.

Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages. Algorand is unique a way that the receiving account should be ready before sending the FT(Erc20) asset. To perform this, the receiving account should transfer the FT(Erc20) asset with 0 amount to itself. During the process, it&#x27;s using the same API as the main transaction: the only difference is that the \&quot;fromPrivateKey\&quot; should be the privateKey of the receiving account. &lt;/p&gt;
