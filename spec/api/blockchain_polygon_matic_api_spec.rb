  # unit tests for polygon_blockchain_smart_contract_invocation
  # Invoke Smart Contract method
  # &lt;h4&gt;2 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Invoke any method on an existing Smart Contract. It is possible to call read or write method on the Smart Contract defined via contractAddress. For read operations, data is returned, for write operations, transaction Id of the associated transaction is returned.&lt;br/&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and loss of funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production, &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Tatum KMS&lt;/a&gt; should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request. Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages.&lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for polygon_generate_wallet
  # Generate Polygon wallet
  # &lt;h4&gt;1 credit per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum supports BIP44 HD wallets. It is very convenient and secure, since it can generate 2^31 addresses from 1 mnemonic phrase. Mnemonic phrase consists of 24 special words in defined order and can restore access to all generated addresses and private keys.&lt;br/&gt;Each address is identified by 3 main values:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Private Key - your secret value, which should never be revealed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public Key - public address to be published&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Derivation index - index of generated address&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tatum follows BIP44 specification and generates for Polygon wallet with derivation path m&#x27;/44&#x27;/966&#x27;/0&#x27;/0.
