  # Send ADA from Tatum ledger to blockchain
  # &lt;h4&gt;10 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send ADA asset from Tatum Ledger to account. This will create Tatum internal withdrawal request with ID. If every system works as expected, withdrawal request is marked as complete and transaction id is assigned to it. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If ADA server connection is unavailable, withdrawal request is cancelled.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If blockchain transfer is successful, but is it not possible to reach Tatum, transaction id of blockchain transaction is returned and withdrawal request must be completed manually, otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without blockchain address assigned to them.&lt;br/&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds.

Assets, which are not used in a transaction are moved to the system address wih the derivation index 0. Address with index 0 cannot be assigned automatically to any account and is used for custodial wallet use cases. For non-custodial wallets, field &lt;b&gt;attr&lt;/b&gt; should be present and it should be address with the index 1 of the connected wallet.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Using keyPair - addresses which are used as a source of the transaction are entered manually&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without blockchain address assigned to them.&lt;br/&gt; This method is a helper method, which internally wraps these steps: &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#operation/storeWithdrawal\&quot;&gt;Store withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; - create a ledger transaction, which debits the assets on the sender account.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#operation/LtcTransferBlockchain\&quot;&gt;Perform blockchain transaction&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#operation/completeWithdrawal\&quot;&gt;Complete withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; - move the withdrawal to the completed state, when all of the previous steps were successful.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address.

  # Create XRP based Asset
  # &lt;h4&gt;2 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create XRP-based Asset in Tatum Ledger. Asset must be created and configured on XRP blockhain before using &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#operation/XrpTrustLineBlockchain\&quot;&gt;Create trust line&lt;/a&gt;. This API call will create Tatum internal Virtual Currency. It is possible to create Tatum ledger accounts with off-chain support. &lt;/p&gt;

  # unit tests for xrp_transfer
  # Send XRP from Tatum ledger to blockchain
  # &lt;h4&gt;10 credits per API call.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Send XRP from account to account. This will create Tatum internal withdrawal request with ID. When every system works as expected, withdrawal request is marked as complete and transaction id is assigned to it. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;If XRP server connection is unavailable, withdrawal request is cancelled.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;If blockchain transfer is successful, but is it not possible to reach Tatum, transaction id of blockchain transaction is returned and withdrawal request must be completed manually, otherwise all other withdrawals will be pending.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; It is possible to perform ledger to blockchain transaction for ledger accounts without blockchain address assigned to them.&lt;br/&gt; This operation needs the private key of the blockchain address. Every time the funds are transferred, the transaction must be signed with the corresponding private key. No one should ever send it&#x27;s own private keys to the internet because there is a strong possibility of stealing keys and losing funds. In this method, it is possible to enter privateKey or signatureId. PrivateKey should be used only for quick development on testnet versions of blockchain when there is no risk of losing funds. In production, &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://github.com/tatumio/tatum-kms\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Tatum KMS&lt;/a&gt; should be used for the highest security standards, and signatureId should be present in the request. Alternatively, using the Tatum client library for supported languages. &lt;/p&gt;
